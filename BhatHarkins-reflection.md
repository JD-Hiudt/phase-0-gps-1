* What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session? I was struggling with remembering the steps of the workflow...specifically what needed to happen in the terminal to successfully push a file to GitHub.

* What concepts were clarified during the GPS? I was very happy to solidify the concepts of branching during this session. I also got more practice with the entire workflow, which was great!

* What questions did you ask your pair and the guide? I asked a variety of questions during the pairing process, from general housekeeping rules to questions of what particular command needed to be typed, what it meant to navigate vs. drive, and what steps to take.

* What still confuses you about Git? I feel like the confusing aspects of Git are more of a familiarity thing vs a "I don't know what that is at all"-thing. I hope to just go over the concepts and terminology multiple times until it becomes intrinsic knowledge.

* How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS? I enjoyed the experience of pairing and found it quite a bit different from my solo coding. On the positive side, when I got stuck on a step, there was someone there to talk through what it meant and how to do it! On the negative side, it was challenging to work with someone new and have to explain everything in my head to another person. Overall, it was interesting to have a completely new personality and coding style to work with and mesh styles with!
