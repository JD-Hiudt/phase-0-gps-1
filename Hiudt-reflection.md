What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
    - Creating a Repository - New Project
What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
    - being very methodical when reading instructions
    - navigator/drive role when issuing push/pull requests
What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
    - I tended to ask the guide little clarifying questions - mostly about navigating GitHub at times.
    - My pair and I feed each others questions because most of them were similar and needed clarification
What still confuses you about Git?
    - when to create vs. when clone vs. when to keep repo up to date
How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
    - As a first experience with pair, I got off to a nervous rough start.  I would have liked to be more familiar with the project instructions prior, which I wasn't sure if it was acceptable.  Ran out of time - so being more familiar would have helped
